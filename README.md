1 (Title). Rubik's Cube Live Output

2 (Overview). Our proposal is to write a program to provide a live output of the speedcuber’s moves during a solve in Rubik’s Cube Notation based on multiple camera angles and provide a live 2-D display of the cube’s state.

3 (Requirements). OpenCV library

4 (Installation instructions). https://www.learnopencv.com/install-opencv3-on-macos/

5 (Run instructions). cube.py: Running this gives a 2-D Display of a cube, which you can move around with moves in Cube Notation on the commandline.  edgedetection.py: Running this with a file of a cube image gives a black and white image with the white edges. None of the other programs are functional yet.
